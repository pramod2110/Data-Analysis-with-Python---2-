## Cars Dataset Analysis using Pandas

In this project, we perform big data analysis using Pandas functions on the Cars Dataset.

### Data Source

The cars dataset used in this analysis was obtained from [Data Science Lovers](www.datasciencelovers.graphy.com).

The provided CSV file contains data on various cars, including details such as:
- Make
- Model
- Type (e.g., SUV, Sedan)
- Origin (continent)
- Drivetrain (e.g., front, all-wheel drive)
- Manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP)
- Invoice price
- Engine size
- Number of cylinders
- Horsepower
- City and highway miles per gallon (MPG)
- Weight
- Wheelbase
- Length

Each row represents a different car model, with attributes separated by commas. The dataset offers a comprehensive overview of car specifications from different manufacturers and regions.

During the analysis, we utilized powerful Pandas functions such as `isin`, `isnull().sum()`, `apply`, among others, to extract insights and perform data manipulation tasks efficiently. These functions enable us to:
- Filter data based on specific criteria
- Handle missing values
- Apply custom operations across the dataset

This facilitated a thorough examination and understanding of the information contained within the dataset.
